\chapter{UML}
  Languages are used to define something (non ambiguously) to share information, and they also create a framework to enable a certain type of reasoning. For this reason the Unified Modeling Language was born, and for this reason we're studying it. 

  \section{Object Oriented}
  The process of learning is based on the constant correction of wrong models, this idea is why OO became popular. It forces the developer


  \section{Design Issues}
  Non ho idea di cosa c'era prima

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Decomposability}: simplifying a problem to incrementaly make it more complex later
    \item \textbf{Compatibility}:
    \item \textbf{Understandability}: 
    \item \textbf{Protection}: low coupling to avoid propagation of side effects if an error occurs
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Objects}

  \subsection{Object states}
  Current values of the object's fields that uniquely define its behaviour. Given a state and a state diagram its always possible to deterministicaly determine how the state should change when a certain event occurs.

  For each state we can define actions to be performed on entry, exit and while the object is in the specific state.
